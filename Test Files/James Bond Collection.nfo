  <title>James Bond Collection</title>
  <id>645</id>
  <plot>The complete theatrical release collection of all of the James Bond films, the original 1962 release of 'Dr. No' to the most current. With all of the action, adventure, gadgetry &amp;amp; film scores that Bond is famous for. (We do not consider the 1954 release of Casino Royale for this series because it was actually a television episode and not a theatrical film. The series beginning with 2006 is part of a reboot, and not a continuation of the original James Bond series or continuity.)</plot>
